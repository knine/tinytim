  Tiny Tim Release Notes
  ----------------------

  Version 1.0
  -----------
  January 1992  -  
        Tiny Tim v1.00 released

  February 6, 1992  -  
        Tiny Tim v1.01 released - added sinc interpolation option

  February 14, 1992 - 
        Tiny Tim v1.02 released - Fixed incorrect FOC f96 rotation value
        in pupil.tab file.  The old value was obtained from TIM and was
        46 degrees, the correct value is 56 degrees.  This is also being
        fixed in TIM.

  February 26, 1992 -
	Tiny Tim v1.03 released - Fixed a problem in which the filenames
	were too long for the allocated character strings.  The strings
	are now 150 characters long.

  Version 2.0
  -----------

  May 1992 -
	Tiny Tim v2.0 released.  Added WFPC II and COSTAR-corrected FOC
	f48 and f96 camera options; added table of date-dependent aberrations
	which account for mirror moves and desorption; changed the pixel
	integration method for more accurate (and often faster) results;
	fixed bugs in the obscuration drawing routines; change the names
	of some files and deleted Version 1 routines not used in Version 2;
	removed code to compute aperture throughput (effects caused by 
	the position-dependent throughput is supposedly taken care of by
	flat fielding).

  Version 2.1
  -----------

  August 1992 -
	Version 2.1 uses a convergence-tested sinc interpolation routine
	in the pixel integration code.  This gets rid of most of the bad
	pixels seen in some Version 2.0 PSFs.  A bug was fixed in the 
	FITS writer which caused some occasional errors on the VAX side.
	The default aberrations for WFPC now include coma.  The numbering
	of the WFPC II WFC cameras was changed, and the additional 
	rotation of the PC II spiders was removed.  The default aberration
	table for the current HST cameras has been updated to reflect the
	recent (August 1992) mirror move.  A revised desorption equation
	has also be implemented.  The image file output code has been 
	modified to allow faster I/O on the VAX side.  The FOC pixel size
	was changed to 25 microns to be in better agreement with the pixel
	scale on geometrically corrected images.

  October 1992 -
	WFPC II fixes only.  Fixed errors in the WFPC II pupil function.
	The spiders were not being drawn for the WFPC II PC camera and
	the spiders for the WFPC II WFC cameras were only half the width
	they should be.  The obscuration shifting code was wrong for
	WFPC II.  All have been fixed, but the actual orientation of
	the WFPC II spiders relative to the OTA is still unknown. 
	This is relatively insignificant.


  Version 2.2
  -----------

  November 1992 -
	Version 2.2 was an experimental version, not released.

  Version 2.3
  -----------

  January 1993 -
	Added the August and November 1992 mirror moves to the focus
	table, and included an updated desorption curve to aber.c.
	An extra vignetting source was added to the Wide Field Cameras
	to account for the attenuation of one side of the wings which
	occurs uniformly across a chip.  This is a definite and unabashed
	kludge, and I don't want to hear any complaints about it!  This
	gets rid of most of the "cratering" in deconvolutions caused by 
	previous PSFs being too bright in the wings.  You can omit this
	by setting all of the values in the "Wfc # vignetting params"
	line to zero in the parameter file produced by tiny1.

  Version 2.4
  -----------

  August 1993 -
	Added FOC refocus.  Modified integration routine to reduce errors
	caused by FFT noise.  Added WFPC2 filter throughputs.  Modified
	mirror map shifting code.  User can now choose to generate a
	subsampled PSF even if the detector is not undersampling.  All
	code was modified to that it would compile using DEC C on Alpha
	VMS systems.  Did some serious changing of the default aberrations,
	based on recent phase retrieval fits.  Includes a "fudge factor"
	to get the FOC focus to agree with the observed stuff.  The code
	was modified to run smoothly on DEC Alpha systems.

  Version 3.0
  -----------

  March 1994 -
	Added new mirror maps for WFPC and WFPC2 based on on-orbit WFPC2
	phase retrieval.  Included measured aberrations for WFPC2 and 
	COSTAR+FOC.  Included WFPC2 camera focus offsets and position-
	dependent focus due to CCD tilts.  Normally sampled WFPC2 PSFs are
	now convolved with the average measured pixel scattering function.
	Updated COSTAR+FOC pupil rotation and aperture location.

  Version 3.0a
  ------------

  April 1994 -
	Fixed bug in which memory was not cleared when allocated.  Fixed
	bug in which the scattering and focus slope flags were switched
	inside the software.  Adjusted sinc limit radius for wavelengths
	greater than 600 nm, getting rid of some artifacts which show up
	at longer wavelengths.  Added #include stuff for MSDOS. Modified
	tiny1 so that it tells the user that the subsampling factor is
	along an axis, plus clarified it in the manual.

 Version 4.0
 -----------

 August 1994 -
	Use new mirror maps for FOC and FOC+COSTAR by adjusting new map
	with secondary mirror map obtained from ground based tests.  Revised
	default aberrations and desorption curve.  Allow WFPC2 and WF/PC-1
	PSFs to be computed up to a diameter of 15" for wavelengths longer
	than 380 nm and 30" for wavelengths longer than 550 nm.  Fixed bug
	in Alpha VMS file writer which was slowing down I/O.  Modified the
	FFT routine which results in speed improvements of up to 40% (thanks
	to David Robinson for the suggestions).


 Version 4.0a
 ------------

 August 1994 -
	Fixed memory leak caused by failure to deallocate temporary array.
	Adjusted rotation of WFPC1 PC6 by 0.6 degrees.

 Version 4.0b
 ------------

 September 1994 -
	Fixed bug in FFT routine which caused severely erroneous results
	in PSFs using 1280 grid size.  Critically sampled PSF array was
	being improperly passed to output routines; fixed error.

 Version 4.1
 -----------

 February 1996 -
	Added option to use many wavelengths to sample medium, wide, and
	longpass filters for WF/PC-1 and WFPC2.  Updated WFPC2 pixel scatter
	kernel.  Fixed mirror map shifting for COSTAR+FOC.  Included
	aberrations for each PC camera based on phase retrieval.  Fixed
	bad WF/PC-1 WF4 aberration file.

 Version 4.1N - NICMOS Support - Richard Hook (ST-ECF, rhook@eso.org)
 -----------------------------

 October 1996 - 
        preliminary support for producing PSFs for the 2nd generation
        NICMOS instrument on HST were added. The options for specifying
        the wavelengths and weights were also modified to allow a text
        file of wavelengths and weights to be used.

 -----------

 November 1996 -
        Version with NICMOS support tidied up, tested and better documented.

-----------
WFC3 support


Version 7.1
-----------
Dec 2010

Added "secondary mirror despace" as a parameter to tiny1 which is used
to modify the Z4 Focus parameter as follows: Z4 += despace * 0.011.
Despace is in microns between primary and secondary mirrors, with
negative despace corresponding to moving the mirrors closer together.

Version 7.2
-----------
Feb 2011 

Clarifications to WFC3 and ACS PSF and scene pixel size messages,,
mainly indicators that the pixel size shown is critically-sampled
and/or undistorted/distorted.

Updates to the WFC3 .pup and .tab files.  These include the
wfc3_uvis1.pup, wfc3_uvis2.pup, wfc3_uvis1.tab, wfc3_uvis2.tab,
wfc3_ir.pup, and wfc3_ir.tab files. The UVIS .tab files have been
updated to set the Z4-Z8 coeffs to non-zero, which activates the
coeffs in the .pup files. The .pup files have had their X/Y astig and
coma coeffs swapped, to match their intended use in the code.  A 3rd
charge diffusion kernel has also been added to the UVIS .pup files.

Version 7.3
-----------
Mar 2011 

Fix from Marc W. Buie for multi-threading on hosts with more than 5
CPUs,  limiting threads to 5.

Version 7.4
-----------
Jun 2011

Updates to the WFC3 .pup and .tab files. The wfc3_ir.tab file has been
updated to set the Z4-Z8 coeffs to non-zero, which activates the
coeffs in the wfc3_ir.pup file. The V2,V3 coordinates for both IR and
UVIS have been updated using a more recent idctab, as described in the
files.

Version 7.5
-----------
Nov 19 2012

Fixed bug in focus adjustment for NICMOS,  modify par file z4 vs. Z4.
